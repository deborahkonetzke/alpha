<p>Notes
Tips you might find useful:
Don’t put all of ONE ingredient in the feed chute simultaneously. You should try to mix them up while tossing them in the juicer. For instance: try 3 pieces of cut carrot and 3 pieces of chopped celery ribs in one go. This way, the drink will get even more mixed up.
Be gentle with the pusher. Sometimes when you rush things, things… splash. I mean the ingredients might get spun straight off to the pulp container before they get squeezed properly if you apply too much pressure. Think of it more as a lid or a “lodger” than a pusher.
Go easy on the ginger. Although it’s the “zing” factor, this is a totally personal choice. You might want to use less ginger, or maybe none, if you choose to. But I really do recommend it, if not for its taste then for its benefits.
Ginger should not go last. Since the amount of ginger used is tiny, it needs to be washed down by other watery fruits or veggies. Putting the ginger in between the carrots or celery ribs would be
best.
