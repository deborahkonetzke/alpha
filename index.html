I’ve gotten really into juicing recently, and this carrot apple celery ginger juice recipe is one of my proudest accomplishments to date. It calls for simple ingredients you can find at any grocery store or local market, and yields a healthy, drinkable treat that is packed with nutrients, antioxidants, minerals and vitamins. And, that luscious color is so hard to resist, yum!

Instructions
 

    Wash everything thoroughly with clean water.
    Peel and cut the carrots into quarters, vertically. Peel the apple and slice them into chunks. Chop the celery ribs into 3 equal parts. Scrape off the skin of the ginger.
    Run all the ingredients through an intoxicating juicer.
    Stir to mix the juice up. Divide the juice into small portions, add ice cubes, and enjoy. Preserve the leftover juice in an airtight jar to avoid oxidation.

Notes
Tips you might find useful:
Don’t put all of ONE ingredient in the feed chute simultaneously. You should try to mix them up while tossing them in the juicer. For instance: try 3 pieces of cut carrot and 3 pieces of chopped celery ribs in one go. This way, the drink will get even more mixed up.
Be gentle with the pusher. Sometimes when you rush things, things… splash. I mean the ingredients might get spun straight off to the pulp container before they get squeezed properly if you apply too much pressure. Think of it more as a lid or a “lodger” than a pusher.
Go easy on the ginger. Although it’s the “zing” factor, this is a totally personal choice. You might want to use less ginger, or maybe none, if you choose to. But I really do recommend it, if not for its taste then for its benefits.
Ginger should not go last. Since the amount of ginger used is tiny, it needs to be washed down by other watery fruits or veggies. Putting the ginger in between the carrots or celery ribs would be
best.
